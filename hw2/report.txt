I made a mistake on the calculation part. I had to calculate the default case where the value of viles is less than 100, but I did not put the calculation part for it. So I had correct output value for case 1, but not for case 2. As it returned 71 as an output, which is a base cost for luxury car, it wasn't too hard to figure out that I missed the calculation part. Also for the part where it asks for string as an input, it skipped the next part of getting an input since there is a unwanted buffer remaining. So I put cin.ignore() to clear the previous buffer and get a new string input.
